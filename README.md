## True Size Atlas

The centerpiece of Awesome Rank. An interactive equal-area map that reveals how big countries *actually* are when you strip away the distortion of traditional maps.

**Compare anything to anything.** Select up to 10 entities simultaneously — countries, continents, subregions, or individual states/provinces — and see them overlaid at true scale on a single map.

- **Unified search** with tag filters: toggle between countries, continents, subregions, and states/provinces. Type in any language — English, Korean, ISO codes — and get instant autocomplete results grouped by category.
- **Drag to reposition.** Click a legend label to select an entity, then drag it across the map to visually compare it against others. Each entity gets a distinct color from a 10-color palette.
- **Zoom deep.** Scroll wheel, pinch, or use the slider to zoom from 0.6× to 40×. Pan the entire map or move individual entities.
- **Two resolution modes.** Quick overview at 110m, or switch to high-detail 10m for coastline-accurate comparisons.
- **Fullscreen mode** with forced landscape on mobile devices for maximum map real estate.
- **Area blocks** — proportional squares that make area differences immediately obvious at a glance.
- **Live ranking table** that highlights your selected entities among the full area ranking, with official CIA World Factbook totals.
- **Stats strip** showing each entity's area and global rank in a horizontally scrollable card row.

Powered by D3-geo's Equal Earth projection, which preserves area accuracy across the entire map — unlike Mercator, which makes Greenland look the size of Africa.

## World Rank Quiz

A 15-question lifestyle quiz that estimates your global standard of living using Bayesian probability scoring.

- Questions span three dimensions: **Infrastructure** (electricity, sanitation, clean water), **Connectivity** (internet, smartphone, broadband), and **Assets** (refrigerator, washing machine, housing)
- Each question is weighted by real-world global probability data (e.g., 89% of humans have electricity, but only 40% have a washing machine)
- Results include a **global percentile** and a **tier badge** — from "Baseline" to "Visionary Elite"
- Shareable via URL

## Global Profile

- **Height percentile** — by gender and country, using statistical distribution data
- **Age percentile** — how many of the 8 billion are younger or older than you
- **Birthday rarity** — how common or rare your birth date is globally
